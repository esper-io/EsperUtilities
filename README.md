## Features

- Open source: Lightweight, clean and secure.
- Material Design: Like the good old [Cabinet](https://github.com/aminb/cabinet), also with dark mode.
- Breadcrumbs: Navigate in the filesystem with ease.
- Linux-aware: Like [Nautilus](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Apps/Files), knows symbolic links, file permissions and SELinux context.
- Robust: Uses Linux syscalls under the hood, not yet another [`ls` parser](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7994720).
- Well-implemented: Built upon the right things, including Java NIO2 File API and LiveData.

## Things not yet in Beta 1...

- Search files.
- Extracting archives.
- File operations with root.
- More in [Issues](https://github.com/zhanghai/MaterialFiles/issues).
